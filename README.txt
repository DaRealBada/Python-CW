WELCOME to my first year intro to programming coursework.

Briefing of all my modules and sections:

Main Menu
The main menu provides an easy to use text-based interface allowing the user to access the main functional areas of the system by entering simple single letter menu choices. 
Behind the scenes, the menu ties together the capabilities provided in the various integrated modules. 
One limitation noticed is that when displaying the full game catalog, occasionally the text can exceed the terminal viewport size. Scrolling support or pagination could improve usability here.

Game Search
The game search module enables looking up games by title, genre or platform. 
Users enter search strings which are matched against the game inventory data to find matches.
The search works well in general usage, but does require the user to enter words accurately to return best results. 
In the future, partial word matching could provide more flexibility.

Game Rental
Handling new game rentals is a key aspect of the system, facilitated by this module. 
Some intermittent issues were noticed where occasionally the user has to re-enter details like game ID and rental date to process a rental. 
Tightening input validation and handling edge cases would help minimize these annoyances.

Game Return
The game return function allows the user to easily log returned rentals by entering the game ID and return date which appropriately updates rental history records. 
As with rentals, some input validation improvements could reduce errors requiring multiple entry of data.

Inventory Analysis
Data visualization features help managers analyze rental patterns and game popularity to improve purchasing decisions. 
The visualizations provide a wealth of insights, although expanding the depth and interactivity of the graphs could further aid data-driven decision making.

Overall the system delivers core functionality, with opportunities in areas like input handling, data display, and analytics to level up the user experience. 

Thank you!
